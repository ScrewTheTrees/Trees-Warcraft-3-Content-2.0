There are several aspects that causes desyncs in your map:

Using bots:
	Bots have grown unstable due to the new patches.


Terrain Deformations:
	They may cause desyncs, usually a bad idea to use them.
	They are fine to use in singleplayer/campaign.
	I would assume the desync occurs because of the Z location.
	
	
Map Widgitized:
	If your map... or a map before you map is widgitized it might cause the data of unit/abilities/items ... etc...
	To not properly sync up between players... thus causing desyncs (Simple, Avoid Widgitizing your map.)
	
GetLocalPlayer():
	This function gets the local player (usually for IF statements.)
	However doing things that influence the game (Changing unit stats, changing variable values.. etc.. etc..) Obviously causes a desync (as the lockstep engine is no longer able to replicate the exact same conditions.).
	
	
Using "Pan camera as necessary":
	Dont know why it happens, but it does.
	
	
Using more 15 tiles:
	The 16th tile is known to be corrupted.
	
	
Following gameplay constants:
	GuardDistance
	MaxGuardDistance
	GuardReturnTime
	BuildingPlacementNotifyRadius
	NeutralUseNotifyRadius
	CreepCampPathingCellDistance
	
	*I dont have a theory about these.
