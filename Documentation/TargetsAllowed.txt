The "Targets Allowed" field for attacking and abilities work in a very specfic way, as explained here.
There are 4 subcategories in this bitfield, these categories stack with each other as "AND" and "OR".
"Widget targets" stack as "OR" with the 3 other categories, they are independent.
Primary Unit Targets stack as "AND" with Unit Attributes and Unit Targeting Flags, IE when "Friend, Air" is used its gonna target your air units.
Every tag inside each category stack with each other as "OR".
